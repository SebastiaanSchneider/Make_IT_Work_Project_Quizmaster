This is the code for the Quizmaster group project for the Make IT Work course.
It is a simple program for the purpose of allowing students to take tests for school subjects. It includes functionality to log in as several different kinds of users, manage the user base and manage quizzes, using a MySQL database.

I was mainly responsible for the functionality related to "groups" (model/Group, controller/ManageGroupsController, controller/CreateUpdateGroupController, database.mysql/GroupDAO, javacouchdb/GroupCouchDBDAO, view/fxml/manageGroups and view/fxml/createUpdateGroup). I also created the functionality for students to select a quiz to take, which includes data on their last attempt (controller/SelectQuizForStudent).

The final product was graded at an 8/10 and my individual grade was an 8.1/10.
